# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Overview
This project aims to develop a logistic regression model to identify 'Hot Leads' for **X Education**, with the goal of increasing the lead conversion rate from 30% to 80%. By analyzing historical lead data, we aim to predict which leads are most likely to convert into paying customers.

## Objectives
- Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100.
- Identify the most promising leads for targeted communication by the sales team.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve the lead conversion process.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains approximately 9000 records of leads with various attributes including:
- Lead Source
- Total Time Spent on Website
- Total Visits
- Last Activity
- Converted (target variable)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle null values, especially those labeled as 'Select', and perform feature selection.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features that impact lead conversion.
3. **Model Development**: Develop a logistic regression model using the processed dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC curve.
5. **Business Insights**: Interpret results and provide recommendations based on findings.

## Results
- A well-commented Jupyter Notebook with the logistic regression model, predictions, and evaluation metrics.
- Visualizations that illustrate model performance and key feature contributions.
- A Word document addressing specific questions from the company regarding model performance and insights.
- A presentation summarizing the analysis approach, results, and recommendations.
